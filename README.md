# coral_id
Automated coral id tool

I am building a little tool to identify the different species of corals, from photos of transects/quadrants. 

The first part (currently being built) is about data edition... not too exciting. It takes a photo and a tagged image and creates a training dataset.
Each pair of images (photo + tagged) will output smaller images and it's correspondoing tag, based on the dominant species present in that smaller image.

The second part will consist on identifying corals from an untagged image.
